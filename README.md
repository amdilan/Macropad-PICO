This is my attempt in making my own macropad.
- Here I am using a RP2040 microcontroller (PICO),
- Using Circuitpython v9. You can get the latest version of circuitpython [here](https://circuitpython.org/downloads),
- With [KMK Keyboard firmware](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware) library.
- I am having 28 buttons (7 column, 4 rows) and using 2 rotary encoders. Using the encoders as 8<sup>th</sup> column and each in 1<sup>st</sup> & 2<sup>nd</sup> rows. Hence total of 30 buttons & 2 encoders.

Thank you for visiting this repo.
